# Patient Monitoring System

A comprehensive microservices-based healthcare management system built with Spring Boot, Docker, gRPC, Kafka, and AWS infrastructure.


## üèó System Architecture

The system follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **Patient Service**: Core patient management with CRUD operations  
- **Billing Service**: Handles billing operations via gRPC  
- **Analytics Service**: Processes patient events from Kafka  
- **Auth Service**: JWT-based authentication and authorization  
- **API Gateway**: Central entry point with JWT validation  
- **Kafka Broker**: Message streaming for event-driven communication  
- **PostgreSQL Databases**: Persistent data storage for each service
